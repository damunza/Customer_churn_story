# Predict Customer Churn & Tell the Story

## Objective

Work through the full data science workflow on a single real-world dataset: customer churn prediction.

## Steps 

### 1. Get the Data

Use the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset?resource=download).

### 2. Data Preparation

Clean missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numeric features.

### 3. Document assumptions you make.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize churn vs non-churn distributions (age, tenure, contract type, etc.).

Identify the top factors correlated with churn.

### 4. Modeling

Train at least two models (e.g., Logistic Regression vs Random Forest).

Evaluate with precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC.

Handle class imbalance if present (SMOTE or class weights).

### 5.Interpretability

Use feature importance, SHAP, or LIME to explain predictions.

Answer: “What are the main drivers of churn?”

### 6. Communication

Create a short report or dashboard (e.g., in Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, or Power BI)

Summarize findings as if you’re presenting to a business team:

Who is most at risk of leaving?

What actions should the company prioritize?
